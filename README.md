A basic event planner to practice forms and Google Polymer for
Udacity's Senior Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Try It Out

Make sure you have gulp, npm, and bower installed by running this in the
project's root directory:

```sh
sudo npm install -g gulp bower
```

Then download the npm and bower dependencies:

```sh
bower install && npm install 
```

Compile the project files:

```sh
gulp
```

And see the results:

```sh
cd dist && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```


For the first time through you'll have to create an account (it gets
saved to IndexedDB for future logins).
